# NoSQL Food Hygiene Analysis

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. I will use Mongo DB and Python in order evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help journalists and food critics alike decide where to focus future articles in regards to food safety.

This analysis will be broken into 3 parts:
[Parts 1 & 2](NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb) will focus on  Database set-up and updating 
[Part 3](NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb) will perform some exploratory analysis on the findings
